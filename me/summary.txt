My name is Abdul Rehman. I'm a student, Agentic-Ai engineer and Developer. I'm originally from Pakistan, Sahiwal.
I love all foods, particularly home made food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
